Glad you made it all the way to my personal website. You can find all the information you need right here.

In case we haven't met yet, I'm Fabrice, a cognitive neuroscientist during the day and during the night as well. Currently I am in the final stages of my PhD at the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford. Under the supervision of [prof. Christopher Summerfield](http://decisions.psy.ox.ac.uk/) I have studied how the human brain works while we make decisions or learn to recognise structure in the world. Usually that means fitting a cap full of electrodes on people's heads and record their brain activity while they do some computer task. Combine that with modelling human behaviour. The aim is to understand brain mechanisms better that in turn can inform us how AI technology can be improved. You can find all my work right [here](publications). As a proponent of open science, all the code for my projects should be available on my [Github](https://github.com/FabriceLuyckx) or [OSF](osf.io/zjh24) pages.

## Data, data, data

Ever since I learned to code experiments in C during my Bachelor's degree at the University of Ghent, I haven't stopped playing around with data. Professionally that has mainly involved working in Matlab and R, but the last year I have started to dabble in Python. My goal is to learn more about machine learning and further enhance my data visualisation skills.

Have a look at [my side projects](projects) while you are here!
